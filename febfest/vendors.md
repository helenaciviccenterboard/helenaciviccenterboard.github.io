One of Helena’s most popular events welcomes vendors who sell chocolate, candy, dessert delicacies, Valentine gifts, arts and crafts:

- **Chocolate/Candy/Dessert**

  Chocolate, candy, dessert delicacies or other food may be sold in bite, regular, or whole size portions. If you plan to serve or sell food, you **must** contact the City-County Health Department food inspectors (406-443-2584) at least two weeks prior to Feb Fest for a free short term permit or license. Also, the City-County Health Department requires food handlers to use a utensil or wear disposable gloves.

- **Valentine Gifts**

  The gifts should be appropriate for Valentine’s Day or, as much as possible, carry a Valentine theme.

- **Arts and Crafts**

  Arts and crafts are welcome.

Rates are $75.00 per 10’ wide x 8’ deep space. No commission is charged. **Sales will be open to the public from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.** We offer, at no charge with advance notice, a **Friday evening set up from 3:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.** otherwise the set-up will begin Saturday morning at **7:00 a.m.** Displays are to be kept in place until the 4:00 p.m. close. Rental fees must accompany registration. **Limit: two spaces per person or group.** An 8’ x 21⁄2’ table, electricity and 2 chairs are available to you at no charge, if needed. You are responsible for your merchandise and display equipment. The Civic Center Board is not responsible for loss, theft, or breakage.

**We encourage you to return your application promptly, but not prior to Dec. 1, 2017**, as spaces are limited. To have a balanced Feb Fest, we reserve the right to limit the number of vendors with the same kind of merchandise.

Spaces will be designated by number; failure to comply with your assigned space is grounds for removal. The Chairperson of Feb Fest is backed by the Civic Center Board and has full authority over the event in any cases of noncompliance. The Chairperson's decision is final. **Fire/safety rules require proper aisles be maintained at all times. Merchandise will not be allowed next to, or on balcony railings.**

**We will confirm your registration in early January.** If space is no longer available when we receive your registration, we will place your name on the waiting list. **In case of cancellation, we will make refunds if we are notified by not later than Friday, Feb. 1, 2019.**

There will be a $3.00 admission charge at the door with **all** proceeds going to the Civic Center Improvement Fund. Your registration includes two free admissions for workers at your booth; others must pay $3.00.
