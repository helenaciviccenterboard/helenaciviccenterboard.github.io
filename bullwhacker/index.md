In September, 1976, John B. Weaver’s model of "The Bullwhacker" was chosen for a monument depicting a phase of the early history of what was destined to become the Capitol City of Montana.  A larger than life monument created from this "sketch model" has been permanently installed on the downtown pedestrian mall on Last Chance Gulch in Helena, Montana.  The monument has become a centerpiece of the birthplace of this dynamic city.

The members of the Helena Civic Center Board’s decision to cast a limited edition of 100 castings marks a first for the works of eminently noted sculptor, John B. Weaver.  This is the first and only sketch that Weaver has allowed to be cast.  It represents a unique work by this artist.  There is no doubt that this bronze will become a sought after collector’s item.

## About John B. Weaver

John B. Weaver was virtually predestined to become a western artist.  He was born in Anaconda, Montana in 1920.  His father was a distinguished artist whose paintings and sculptures depicted life in the silver mining camps, and his own love of the west dates back to a long boyhood with his 90 year old grandmother, who had come west on a covered wagon in the 1860’s.

After studying at the Art Institute of Chicago, Weaver taught at the Layton School of Art in Milwaukee, was curator at the Montana Historical Society for five years, and then spent six years as Natural History Sculptor for the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C.

Among his other major commissions are the Charles M. Russell bronze at Statuary Hall in Washington, D. C., monumental memorials at Butte and Helena, Montana, and portrait busts of President Harry S. Truman and General Douglas MacArthur.  Weaver’s works have also been found in numerous private collections, including those of Mrs. Aristotle Onassis and Mrs. Lyndon B. Johnson.
