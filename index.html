      The Helena Civic Center Board raises funds to improve our beautiful Helena Civic Center. We raise funds via our three board-sponsored events each year - <a href="/giftshow/">Christmas Gift Shows</a>, <a href="/febfest/">Feb Fest</a> and <a href="/fashionshow/">Artwear Fashion Show</a> - and by selling castings of the <a href="/bullwhacker/">Bullwhacker Bronze</a>.

      <h2>Christmas Gift Shows</h2>
      <h3>Nov. 4 &amp; 11, 2017</h3>
      <p>
        Each November we hold two Christmas gift shows in the Civic Center Ballroom. It&rsquo;s a pleasant way to spend a Saturday, browsing through the crafts, shopping for that special Christmas gift, visiting with friends and neighbors, and enjoying refreshments or lunch at the snack bar.

      <h2>Artwear Fashion Show</h2>
      <h3>Feb. 11, 2017</h3>
      <p>
        To illustrate that there&rsquo;s still beauty and usefulness in recycled things, the Civic Center Board&rsquo;s Feb Fest features Artwear Fashion Shows. From elegant to avant garde, from accessories to footwear and everything in between, anything wearable is fair game for an artist&rsquo;s transformation to wearable art. <b>Re</b>use, <b>re</b>purpose, and <b>re</b>consider what’s in your closet and what you find at the thrift store, your rag bag, or in the bottom of your fabric stash and come &ldquo;strut your stuff&rdquo;.
