      <h2>Christmas Gift Shows</h2>
      <h3>Nov. 3 &amp; 10, 2018</h3>
      <p>
        Each November we hold two Christmas gift shows in the Civic Center Ballroom. It&rsquo;s a pleasant way to spend a Saturday, browsing through the crafts, shopping for that special Christmas gift, visiting with friends and neighbors, and enjoying refreshments or lunch at the snack bar.
