## Feb. 11, 2017

The Artwear Fashion Shows will be held at 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m in the Civic Center Ballroom.

To illustrate that there's still beauty and usefulness in recycled things, the Civic Center Board's [Feb Fest](/febfest/) features Artwear Fashion Shows. From elegant to avant garde, from accessories to garments and everything in between - anything wearable for men, women or children is fair game for an artist's transformation to **wearable art**.

Enjoy the show and then take some pieces home! Artists who participate in the show are invited to register for a booth so you view and buy more of their creations.

## Entry Information

We want to encourage **your** participation! There is **no application fee** for submissions. Artwear must be made from at least 50% recycled or reused materials that would otherwise be discarded or recycled. Let your imagination run wild!
