# Artwear Fashion Show

## Feb 6, 2016

To illustrate that there's still beauty and usefulness in recycled things, the Civic Center Board's [Feb Fest](/febfest/) features Artwear Fashion Shows. From elegant to avant garde, from accessories to footwear and everything in between, anything wearable is fair game for an artist's transformation to wearable art. **Re**use, **re**purpose, and **re**consider what's in your closet and what you find at the thrift store, your rag bag, or in the bottom of your fabric stash and come "strut your stuff".

The Artwear Fashion Shows will be held at 12 noon and 1:30 p.m. Artwear must be made from at least 50% recycled or reused materials that would otherwise be discarded or recycled. Let your imagination run wild and send us photos of your work (up to three photos per piece). We'll have the hard job of choosing pieces to include in the style show. Once pieces are chosen, the decision of the judges is final.

## Artwear Fashion, Materials And Gifts

Vendors who design and/or sell "Re-used", "Re-purposed", and/or "Re-considered" materials in their artwear and gifts are invited to register for a booth so they can display and sell items that aren't included in the fashion shows.
