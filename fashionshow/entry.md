Illustrating that there's still beauty and usefulness in recycled things, the Civic Center Board's Artwear Fashion Shows will showcase fun upcycled wearables. From elegant to avant garde, from accessories to garments and everything in between, anything wearable for men, women or children is fair game for an artist's transformation to **wearable art**. Re-use, re-purpose, upcycle or retro-fashion what's in your closet, what you find at the thrift store or the rag bag in the bottom of your fabric stash. Enter into the fun and creativity of our Artwear Fashion Shows.

There are **two** Fashion Shows - 12:00 p.m. and 1:30 p.m in the Civic Center Ballroom in conjunction with [Feb Fest](/febfest/).

Artwear must be made from at least 50% recycled or reused materials that would otherwise be discarded or recycled. Let your imagination run wild and send us photos of your work (up to three photos per piece). We'll have the hard job of choosing pieces to include in the style show. Don’t be shy, all entries are welcome. There’s **no application fee** for pieces submitted. We want to encourage your participation.

Please complete the [Artwear Fashion Show Entry Form](/fashionshow/ARTWEAR-ENTRY-FORM-2017.doc) for each artwear piece. Entries are due Jan. 30, 2017.

Email <artwear@helenaciviccenterboard.org> for additional information.
